When the game starts, program must display the board with possible moves. The user (1st player) must choose a number from the board to make a move. 
In the chosen position must appear "X".
After the 1st player move, the program must display the board again and a computer (2nd player) generates a random number for a move. 
In the chosen position must appear "O".
The process must proceed until one of the players wins or the board is filled up (indicating that a tie occurred).
At the end of the game, the program announces the winner and displays the game moves from the database.

Each player's moves must be stored in the database.
